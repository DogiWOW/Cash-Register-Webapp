# Cash Register Web Application

Fullstack web application for a school project made using PHP, MYSQL and JS.

## IMPORTANT
The whole application is in polish. I'll maybe translate it in the future.  
To use the application you need to download something that can run APACHE (for example XAMPP) and MySQL.  
Import the "projekt.sql" file to your SQL databases.  
As login credentials use one of the users in the database. I recommend the one with admin privilages.

## Site pages
- Login screen (no registration, you need to use that users from the database)
- Add client
- Add contractor
- Add a new cash register
- Add a cash register inspection
- Manage users (only with admin privilages)
- Write a mail to one of the clients (doesn't work)
